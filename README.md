# 🎉 Calculator App - My First Android Project! 🎉

Welcome to my very first Android app – a **simple yet powerful Calculator** built using Java! 🚀

## 🌟 Project Journey

This project is a significant milestone in my journey as an Android developer. Here’s what I’ve explored and learned while building this calculator:

### 🛠️ **Layouts:**
- **RelativeLayout:** Perfect for positioning elements relative to one another.
- **LinearLayout:** Simplifies the alignment of UI elements in a single row or column.
- **ConstraintLayout:** Offers immense flexibility in designing complex layouts with constraints.

### 🎨 **Design Elements:**
- **TextView:** Displays results and messages on the screen with style.
- **EditText:** Allows users to input their calculations effortlessly.
- **Button:** Makes interaction smooth and intuitive by triggering actions with a tap.

### 💡 **Learning Curve:**
- **XML & Java Integration:** I delved into the world of XML for designing the interface and seamlessly connected these elements with Java code to handle user interactions and calculations.
